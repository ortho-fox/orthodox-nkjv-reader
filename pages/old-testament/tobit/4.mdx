1. On that day Tobit remembered the silver he had entrusted to Gabael at Rages of Media.

2. So he said to himself, “I requested death for myself. Why do I not call my son Tobias to make this known to him before I die?”

3. So he summoned him and said, “My son, if I die, bury me, but do not disregard your mother. Honor her all the days of your life. Do what is pleasing to her, but do not grieve her.

4. Remember, my son, that she experienced many dangers for you while you were in the womb. When she dies, bury her beside me in the same grave.

5. My son, remember the Lord our God all your days, and do not desire to sin or to disobey His commandments. Do righteousness all the days of your life, and do not walk in the ways of wrongdoing.

6. For if you walk in the truth, you will be successful in your works.

7. Do almsgiving from your possessions to all who do righteousness. When you do almsgiving, do not let your eye be envious. Do not turn your face away from any poor man, so the face of God will not be turned away from you.

8. Do almsgiving based on the quantity of your possessions. If you possess only a few, do not be afraid to give according to the little you have.

9. You are storing up a good treasure for yourself in the day of necessity.

10. For almsgiving delivers us from death and prevents us from entering into the darkness.

11. Indeed, almsgiving is a good gift for all who do it before the Most High.

12. “My son, guard yourself from all fornication, and above all take a wife from among the seed of your fathers. Do not take a foreign woman who is not from the tribe of your father, for we are sons of the prophets. Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are our fathers from of old. Remember, my son, that all these took wives from among their brothers and were blessed in their children. Their seed will inherit the land.

13. So now, my son, love your brothers and do not be arrogant in your heart against your brothers, the sons and daughters of your people. Take a wife for yourself from them, for arrogance brings destruction and great disorder, and in such worthlessness there is loss and great defect. For worthlessness is the mother of famine.

14. “Do not keep overnight the wages of any man who works for you, but pay him immediately. If you serve God, He will pay you. Give heed to yourself, my son, in all your works, and be disciplined in all your conduct.

15. What you yourself hate, do not do to anyone. Do not drink wine unto a state of drunkenness, and do not let drunkenness become your traveling companion.

16. From your bread, give to him who is hungry, and from your clothing, give to the naked. If you have more than you need, do almsgiving, and do not let your eye envy the almsgiving when you do it.

17. Spread out your bread on the grave of the righteous, but do not give it to sinners.

18. “Seek counsel from every sensible man, and do not treat any useful advice with contempt.

19. At every opportunity bless the Lord God, but more than this ask that your ways may become straight, and that all your paths and purposes may prosper. For not every nation has understanding. But the Lord Himself gives all that is good, and as He desires He humbles whomever He will. Now my son, let none of my commandments be removed from your heart.

20. “Now let me point out to you the ten talents of silver I entrusted to Gabael the son of Gabrias, in Rages of Media.

21. Do not fear, my son, that we have become poor. For you are very rich if you fear God. Stay away from every sin, and do what is pleasing before Him.”
