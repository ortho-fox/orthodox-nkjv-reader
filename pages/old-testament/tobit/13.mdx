5. He will scourge us for our wrongdoings,

undefined. But He will again have mercy

undefined. And gather us from all the nations,

undefined. Wherever you were dispersed among them.

undefined. And with all your soul,

undefined. To do the truth before Him,

undefined. Then He will turn to y ou

undefined. And not hide His presence from you.

7. Behold for yourself what He will do for you,

undefined. And give thanks to Him fully with the organ of speech.

undefined. Bless the Lord of righteousness,

undefined. And exalt the King of the ages.

8. In the land of my captivity, I give thanks to Him,

undefined. And make known His might and majesty to a nation of sinners.

undefined. Be converted, you sinners,

undefined. And do righteousness before Him.

undefined. Who knows if He will desire you

undefined. And have mercy on you?

9. I exalt my God,

undefined. And my soul exalts the King of heaven

undefined. And will rejoice exceedingly in His majesty.

10. Let all speak of His majesty

undefined. And give thanks to Him in Jerusalem.

undefined. O Jerusalem, the holy city,

undefined. He will scourge you for the deeds of your sons,

undefined. But He will again show mercy to the sons of the righteous.

11. Give thanks to the Lord with goodness

undefined. And bless the King of the ages,

undefined. That His tabernacle may be restored again to you in joy .

12. May He rejoice in ou, the captives,

undefined. And may He love those who are distressed among you

undefined. Unto all generations forever.

13. Many Gentiles will come from afar

undefined. To the name of the Lord God,

undefined. Bearing gifts in their hands

undefined. And offerings to the King of heaven.

undefined. Generations of generations will offer You joyful worship.

14. Cursed are all who hate You;

undefined. Blessed are all who love You forever.

15. Rejoice and be exceedingly glad for the children of the righteous, For they will be gathered together

undefined. And will bless the Lord of the righteous.

undefined. Blessed are those who love You.

undefined. They will rejoice in Your peace.

16. Blessed are the many who grieved over all Your scourges,

undefined. For they will rejoice when they see all Your glory

undefined. And will rejoice forever.

undefined. Let my soul bless God the great King.

17. For Jerusalem will be built with sapphire and emerald,

undefined. And her walls with precious stones,

undefined. And her towers and battlements with pure gold.

undefined. The streets of Jerusalem will be paved

undefined. With beryl, onyx, and stones from Ophir.

18. All her streets will proclaim, ‘Alleluia!’

undefined. And will give praise, saying,

undefined. ‘Blessed is God, who exalted you unto all the ages.’”
