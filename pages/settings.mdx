# Settings / Features

The settings that will be available are as follows. Presently the defaults are shown below with suggestions as to what else is soon to be implimented.

### Text Settings

**Current defaults:**

- [ ] Red Letter
- [ ] Headings
- [x] Verse Numbers
- [ ] Footnotes
- [ ] Crossrefs

1. The option to turn on/off **Red Lettering** of the words of Christ.
2. The option to turn on/off **Headings** that can be interspersed throughout the bible (authoring and placement of these headings will require the approriate approval of clergy/scholars before we'd be comfortable using them.).
3. **Verse Numbers** being shown or hidden to provide a “Reader’s Bible” experience when hidden.
4. **Footnotes** moves this project into Study Bible territory which is outside of the scope of the original goal, but accomodations for such a feature are being developed in anticipation that some day and effort can be made to produce that material.
5. **Crossrefs** also moves this project into Study Bible territory so it should be considered a future-endevour as with Footnotes.

### Layout Settings

**Current defaults:**

- [x] Verse-by-Verse
- [ ] Infinite Scroll

1. Presently each verse is presented **Verse-by-Verse** on a new line by default. We will provide a settings to allow for a continuous flow of verses on the same line to help with the “Reader’s Bible” experience mentioned previously.
2. **Infinite** scroll will allow the reader to continue scrolling when they've reached the end of a chapter rather than having to click through to the next page.

### Illustrations

**Current defaults:**

- [x] Bible Illustrated
- [ ] Pageau ;)

1. We are using <a href="https://bible-illustrated.blogspot.com/2015/04/the-bible.html" className="link" target="_blank">Bojan's Illustrations</a> that he has been working on for years. These are being used to model the concept as he has endeavored to create illustrations that can be interspersed throughout the text of the bible which results in a picture book presentation of the bible. The settings for illustrations suggest that a varierty of illustration sets can be turned on/off making for a richer reading experience either way.
2. I've added the **Pageau** option to suggest that he could be commisioned to create an illustration for each book. The way in which the <a href="https://www.esv.org/" className="link" target="_blank">ESV applicaton</a> (take a look) impliments these is very tasteful and if anyone comes to mind who would do this best it is Pageau.

### Translation

Licensing of NKJV may be an inevitable requirement but is being used to model the application. Please suggest translations that might be better. The challange has been finding the complete Orthodox cannon in digital format. Hand editing of the NKJV deuterocanonical books has been neccesary.

**Current defaults:**

- [x] NKJV - Thomas Nelson: 2008 (OT), 1982 (NT)
- [ ] KJV - 1611
- [ ] Douay-Rheims: 1899

### Audio Settings

**Current defaults:**

- [ ] Follow Text
