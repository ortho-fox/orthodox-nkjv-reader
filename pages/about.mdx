# About

Orthodox Reader is for the Eastern Orthodox Christian faithful. We have a long-term vision of extending this simple reader to be a platform for the creation of reference tools, support for multiple translations and languages, integration of art and icons, etc... It is a work in progress.

Planned features can be understood when looking at the <a href="/settings" className="link">Settings</a>. The experience in the first release of the project will be much like that of the very well-made <a href="https://www.esv.org/Matthew+1/" className="link" target="_blank">ESV application</a>, so we recommend trying that out to get an idea of what to expect in V1.

We will not be limited to one language or translation as things progress. We have built in support for these which we are fine-tuning as we focus on a single translation (NKJV).

We have a strategy for implmenting audio support and will develop a system to acommodate one or many audio options. If we can detetmine what licensing requirements there are for a particular translation we would like to commision a voice professional. In order to set the stage we have gathered a handful of audio tracks in the wild (random YouTubers) to use for developing the system.
